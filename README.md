# Tron-Identity-Disks
This software manages a Tron Identity Disk running on a ESP32 or ESP8266. The goal is for the code to be able to manage all the componenets with different modes and cool effects. This repository will focus mostly on the code starting out and then on the hardware later in the process. Designs for Tron Legacy &amp; Ares should be the final goal!
